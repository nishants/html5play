This is what we’d like to write. Unfortunately, there are a host of compile errors.
When we were generalizing from Money to Expression, we left a lot of loose ends
laying around. I was worried about them, but I didn’t want to disturb you. It’s
disturbing time, now.
We won’t be able to get the test above to compile quickly. We will make the first
change that will ripple to the next and the next. We have two paths forward. We can
make it work quickly by writing a more specific test and then generalizing, or we can
trust our compiler not to let us make mistakes. I’m with you—let’s go slow
