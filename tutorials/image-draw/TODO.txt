TODO
2. pull commons in marker and image draw.
3. Create view to store mark locations in the image.
4. Keep the aspect ratio of the image, 

// Add a tag in image
var image = new Image($imageElement); //imageElement is expected to be an image, or container with image filling up all area.


image.addLocation( { 
	"name"			: "point-one", 
	"location"   	: "22.59, 30.59",
	"description"   : "some text for detail of the location"
	);

image.draw({
	"path-name"		: "reception to room 1"
	"from" 			: "point-one",
	"to"    		: "point-two"
	"description"	: "Enter into turnstile on left side facing reception."
	}
)


Adding tags : 
Marking image 		: By drawing a transparent canvas exactly overlapping the image and drawing on it.
Maintaning position : The positions are maintaned automatically as aspect ration between canvas and image is maintaned.
CANVAS must always resize with the image(poll or event ?).
